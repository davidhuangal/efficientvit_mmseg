# EfficientViT - MMSegmentation
Adapting [EfficientViT](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/efficientvit) models for use with MMSegmentation

Note: Some model variants had backbone configurations listed, but did not have semantic segmentation head configurations listed in the paper or official repo and are thus not implemented here:
* EfficientViT-L0
* EfficientViT-L3
